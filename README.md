                Introduction
------------------------------------------
This is a utility I began to develop to assist our level 1 support in managing our zoom user's accounts.  Shortly into the project, I discovered that the Zoom API actually has very little user management potential and most things our L1 was doing were not covered and as such would still have to be done by hand.  I stopped further development on it, but the user deletion portion was kept around to use for our termination process and later integrated into SailPoint for automation.

                Requirements
------------------------------------------
An active Zoom developer account is required.  The program reads your API keys from a file defined in ZoomUserManager.java on line 38.  Make sure to store these in a secure location and to run the application from an account with access to it.
